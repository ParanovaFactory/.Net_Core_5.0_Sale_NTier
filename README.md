# .NET Core 5.0 Sale N-Tier

## 📄 Description

This project is a **Sales Management Application** built using **.NET Core 5.0** with an **N-Tier Architecture**. The system is designed to manage sales data, customers, inventory, and transactions efficiently. It follows a multi-layered architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. 

The **frontend** uses a **ready-to-use template**, providing a professional design for the user interface. This allows for easy customization and integration into the application without requiring extensive frontend development from scratch. The application supports full CRUD operations for managing sales, customers, and products, making it suitable for real-world business applications.
